# AutoInsurance
Project for the [Ubiquitous Systems course IN5600](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN5600/v19/index.html) at [University of Oslo](https://www.uio.no).

The project description, provided software, project report and project can be found here. Moved my branch from UiO's enterprise-git into my own personal git here.

Made with help from [H. Jenvild](hanscje@ifi.uio.no).
