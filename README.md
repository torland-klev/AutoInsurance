Project for the Ubiquitous Systems course IN5600 (https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN5600/v19/index.html) at University of Oslo.

The project description, provided software, project report, and project can be found here. Moved my branch from UiO's enterprise-git into my own personal git here.

Made with help from Hans Christian Tran√∏y Jenvild (hanscje@ifi.uio.no).
